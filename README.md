# cherry-abandon-syntax theme

Atom Syntax Theme based on my [Aabandon Cream Syntax Theme](https://github.com/Tirjasdyn/AbandonCream-syntax). For a short tutorial on creating a theme.

Cherry Abandon is light theme with highlighting in pinks. Punctuation is called out in different colors as well as HTML entities. I use this with the One Light UI theme. This theme is update to date with Atom 1.60 release.

This theme includes AmpScript spefic hightlighting as well..because SFMC and email FTW. Screenshots on GitHub.
